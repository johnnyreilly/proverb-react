    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Arul "Socrates" Aruldas is a wise old sage often given to spouting sayings that convey wisdom and knowledge far beyond his years.  It was felt that these gems could not be allowed to slip through the cracks.  Here they are preserved for posterity.  Noted down by the bystanders and witnesses to his greatness.</p>
